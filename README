All code is release under BMAB (preferably beer) license, or
MIT if you choose to be a stickler.

This repo contains all the standalone greasemonkey scrips I have writen which 
are usually associated to usability blog posts on my website.  These scripts
are also available at userscripts.org, but I thought I'd have them here as
well so I can update them easier.
